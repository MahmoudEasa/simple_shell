    Exit Status
        0	The script to be executed consisted solely of zero or
            	more blank lines or comments, or both.

        1-125	A non-interactive shell detected an error other than
                command_file not found or executable, including but not
                limited to syntax, redirection, or variable assignment
                errors.

        126	A specified command_file could not be executed due to an
                [ENOEXEC] error (see Section 2.9.1.1, Command Search and
                Execution, item 2).

        127	A specified command_file could not be found by a non-
                interactive shell.

        Otherwise, the shell shall return the exit status of the last
        command it invoked or attempted to invoke (see also the exit
        utility in Section 2.14, Special Built-In Utilities).

        Same error with your program hsh:
        $ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
        ./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
        $ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
        ./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
